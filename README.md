# n-puzzle
n-puzzle game in Java

This program allows you to generate and play a 3x3 or 4x4 n-puzzle. Feel free to try and break it - but if you do, I can't guarantee other size puzzles are solveable!

## How to run
Clone the repo locally, then navigate to `src` and run `java eightPuzzle.eightPuzzV4`


## Documentation
