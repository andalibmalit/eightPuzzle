# n-puzzle
<i>n-puzzle game in Java</i>

This program allows you to generate and play a 3x3 or 4x4 n-puzzle. Feel free to try and break it - but if you do, I can't guarantee other size puzzles are solveable!

## How to compile and run
To compile, first clone the repo locally, then navigate to `src` and run `javac npuzzle/NPuzzleV5.java npuzzle/Tile.java`.
After compiling, you can run in a terminal from the `src` folder with `java npuzzle.NPuzzleV5`.

## Documentation
You can view code comments in the `.java` files.
